# MouseNavigator

A simple room layout tracker for the game [Randomice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835650/Randomice/).

# Instructions

* When you load the tracker there will be a large blank workspace and the side will be lined with room tiles.
* Hover over a room tile to see its name.
* Click and drag room tiles to arrange them as how they're arranged in your seed.
* Right click a room tile to mark it as reversed, which will reverse its colors as well as its sprite.
* Click the French flag icon to change the room names to French, and vice versa to change them back to English.
* Right click the "holes" (little colored rectangles on the edges of rooms) to switch between open, closed, and exit colors.
    * Note that, by default, horizontal holes are set to open, and vertical holes are set to closed.
    * Also note that vertical holes cannot be exit holes.
* Left click and drag away from a hole to draw a line. If you release the click over another hole, then the line will snap to that hole and become permanent. This helps to mark connections when warps are enabled.
    * Left click either connected hole to erase the line and draw a new one.
