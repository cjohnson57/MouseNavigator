# MouseNavigator

A simple room layout tracker for the game [Randomice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835650/Randomice/).

# Instructions

* When you load the tracker there will be a large blank workspace and the side will be lined with room tiles.
* Hover over a room tile to see its name.
* Click and drag room tiles to arrange them as how they're arranged in your seed.
* Right click a room tile to mark it as reversed, which will reverse its colors as well as its sprite.
* Click the French flag icon to change the room names to French, and vice versa to change them back to English.

# Upcoming Features

* Adding nodes around each room to represent that room's entrances and exits
* Add the ability to draw lines between room nodes for the purpose of tracking warp entrances, e.g. in Portal Palace
